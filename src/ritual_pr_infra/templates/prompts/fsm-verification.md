# FSM & Concolic Analysis Review

Review this pull request through the lens of finite state machine representation and verification:

## FSM Representation
- Can the problem/component be framed as a finite state machine?
- Are state transitions clearly defined and documented?
- Are all possible states and transitions accounted for?

## Static Analysis & Verification
- Can we verify correctness a priori without running the code?
- Are there formal invariants that can be checked statically?
- Can concolic analysis be applied to maximize static verification coverage?

## FSM Completeness
- Does the implementation match the FSM representation?
- Are there edge cases or states missing from the FSM model?
- If dynamic testing reveals divergence from the FSM, identify what's missing

## Verification Loop
- Can we establish a succinct verification loop from the FSM?
- What is the delta between the FSM representation and actual behavior?
- If the delta is large, what states or transitions are missing from the FSM?

## Recommendations
- Suggest FSM refinements if the model is incomplete
- Identify opportunities for static analysis to catch bugs before runtime
- Propose formal verification approaches where applicable

Focus on correctness, completeness, and the ability to verify behavior without extensive dynamic testing.
