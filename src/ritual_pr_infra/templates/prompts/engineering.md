# Engineering Standards Review

Review this pull request against core engineering principles and standards:

## Architecture & Design
- Does the design prioritize maintainability and safe failure modes with thoughtful autohealing?
- Are compute, memory, I/O, and networking resources used reasonably and efficiently?
- Is the right framework/tool being used for the job (polyglot when needed)?

## Code Quality & Correctness
- Are there sufficient unit, regression, fuzz, and integration tests?
- Is state localized as tightly as possible to prove code correctness?
- Are representational invariants, pre-conditions, and post-conditions annotated (especially in mission-critical code)?
- Is multithreading/multiprocessing used sparingly and only when needed?

## System Design
- Are failure modes safe and structured?
- Is the design easy to maintain by other team members?

## Documentation
- Is the code well-documented with clear explanations?
- Are diagrams provided where they would aid understanding?

## Security & Integrity
- Are all commits and artifacts properly signed (for OSS components)?

Provide specific, actionable feedback on any violations or areas for improvement.
